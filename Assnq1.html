     Ans 4: Tags are comprised of elements and attributes. An element is an object on a page 
     (such as a heading, paragraph, or image), and attributes are qualities that describe that 
     element (such as width and height). Tags have a pair of open and closing tag.

     The two different type of tag is self-closing tag and Non- self-closing tag.  
     Non-self closing tag is pair of open aand closing tags.
     Self-closing tags contains only one single tag. 
     tags represent the structural components of a document, such as <h1> for headings.

        content.
